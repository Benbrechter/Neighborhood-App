## USAGE:

As a user, you will create an account with login information, your zip code, your e-mail and a fun photo! Once your account is created, you can access your account page from the side navigation.

You will also gain access to a community chore sign up page where our neighbors can ask for help with things around their properties. This will also take the form of a message board which people can then ccomment on to volunteer their services!

There will also be a free giveaway page where people can post items they no longer have a use for and are giving away for free!

All of these fun pages will be accessible from the main homepage which will have a master feed that will pull from the giveaways and the chores. It will also add in the general neighborhood chatter about thing such as lost dogs or wildlife sightings, etc! You will also be able to click on a mail box that will have a pop up that shows you the current month's events!
